## Binary Search

<p>
Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
</p>

**Condition for apply binary search in data structure**

- the data structure must be sorted
- Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

### **Complexity Analysis of Binary Search:**

**Time Complexity:**

<ul>
    <li><b>Best Case:</b> O(1)</li>
    <li><b>Worst Case:</b> O(Log N)</li>
    <li><b>Average Case:</b> O(Log N)</li>
</ul>

**Space Complexity:**

<ul>
    <li><b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)</li>
</ul>

**Advantages of Binary Search:**

<ul>
    <li>Faster than linear search</li>
    <li>More efficient than other searching algorithm</li>
    <li>Well-suited for searching large datasets that are stored in external memory, such as on a hard drive or in the cloud.</li>
</ul>

**Drawbacks of Binary Search:**

<ul>
    <li>The data structure should be sorted in contiguous memory locations. </li>
    <li>the elements of the structure be comparable, meaning that they must be able to be ordered.</li>
</ul>
