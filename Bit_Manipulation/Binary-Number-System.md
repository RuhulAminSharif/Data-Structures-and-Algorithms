**Base of a number system**  
The base of a number is the total number digits used in that system.  

**For example:** For a decimal number system we can use digits from 0 to 9 , therefore the total number of digits  is 10, and hence the base is 10.  

Similarly for a Binary number system we can use 0 or 1 , therefore the total number of digits  is 2, and hence the base is 2.  

**Why are Binary Numbers so Important? Why does a computer only understand binary?**  
This is because a computer is an electrical device and all that an electrical device understands is electrical signals, so if we have to give an input to the computer there would only be two states possible, either there is current or there is no current.  

**Writing numbers in Binary number system and converting Binary numbers to Decimal**  

Representing 1234 in the decimal number system.  
1 x 1000 + 2 x 100 + 3 x 10 + 4 x  1 = 1234  

We would follow the same procedure for a binary number.  
The only difference is that instead of powers of 10 we would have powers of 2 and the digits can only be 0 or 1.

e.g.: Let’s suppose we are given a binary number ‘11101’ and want to convert it into decimal.

Place	16	8	4	2	1  
Digits	1	1	1	0	1  
Therefore the number in binary is = 1 x 16 + 1 x 8 + 1 x  4 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 1 = 29  
Therefore (11101)<sub>2</sub> = (29)<sub>10</sub>
