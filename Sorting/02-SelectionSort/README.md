## Selection Sort

<p>Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.</p>

It is an in-place and unstable sorting algorithm.

Time Complexity: O(N^2)  
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

**<u>Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort : </u>**

- Time Complexity of Insertion Sort
  - worst-case : O(N^2)
  - average case : O(N^2)
  - best case : O(N^1)
- Space Complexity of Insertion Sort
  - auxiliary space complexity : O(1)

**<u>Advantages of Selection Sort</u>**

- Simple
- works well with small datasets

**<u>Disadvantages of Selection Sort</u>**

- time complexity of O(n^2)
- Does not work well on large datasets.
- Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.
